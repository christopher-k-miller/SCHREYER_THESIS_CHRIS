# SCHREYER_THESIS_CHRIS

This is the location for the files and scripts used in the Schreyer Honors Thesis titled "Predicting the Outcome of the Final Sixteen Teams in College Basketball Using Time Series Analysis and Markov Chains".

2 Main R Files:

1. "creating_tidy.r" - This script cleans and runs time-series models for all years in the studied data. Then the selected models are used to create the outcome probabilities (and therefore win predictions) in the markov process.
2. "Analysis.r" - This script takes the data created from the previous script and creates the tables and graphs used in the thesis paper.
